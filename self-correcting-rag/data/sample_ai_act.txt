        EU AI Act - Key Provisions
        
        The European Union Artificial Intelligence Act establishes a comprehensive regulatory framework
        for AI systems based on risk levels. The Act categorizes AI systems into four risk categories:
        
        1. UNACCEPTABLE RISK (Prohibited):
        - Social scoring systems by governments
        - Real-time biometric identification in public spaces (with limited exceptions for law enforcement)
        - AI systems that manipulate human behavior to circumvent free will
        - AI systems that exploit vulnerabilities of specific groups
        
        2. HIGH-RISK AI SYSTEMS:
        High-risk AI systems must comply with strict requirements including:
        - Risk management systems
        - High-quality training data and data governance
        - Technical documentation and record-keeping
        - Transparency and provision of information to users
        - Human oversight measures
        - Robustness, accuracy, and cybersecurity
        
        Examples of high-risk AI include:
        - Biometric identification and categorization
        - Critical infrastructure management
        - Educational and vocational training systems
        - Employment, worker management, and self-employment access
        - Access to essential services (credit scoring, emergency services)
        - Law enforcement systems
        - Migration, asylum, and border control management
        - Administration of justice and democratic processes
        
        3. LIMITED RISK:
        Systems with transparency obligations, such as chatbots where users should be
        informed they're interacting with AI.
        
        4. MINIMAL RISK:
        Most AI systems fall here with no specific obligations beyond existing laws.
        
        COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS:
        - Providers of high-risk AI must conduct conformity assessments
        - CE marking required for compliant high-risk AI systems
        - Post-market monitoring and incident reporting obligations
        - AI systems must maintain logs for auditing purposes
        
        GOVERNANCE:
        - EU AI Office established for coordination
        - National competent authorities in each member state
        - European Artificial Intelligence Board for guidance
        
        PENALTIES:
        - Up to €35 million or 7% of global annual turnover for prohibited AI violations
        - Up to €15 million or 3% of turnover for other violations
        - Up to €7.5 million or 1.5% of turnover for supplying incorrect information
        
        The Act applies to providers placing AI systems on the EU market and users of AI systems
        within the EU, regardless of where the provider is located.
